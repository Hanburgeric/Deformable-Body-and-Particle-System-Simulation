An extension of the previous project, [Pinball](https://github.com/Hanburgeric/Pinball), except with a focus on the physical properties of deformable bodies and fluids, along with their respective interactions (i.e. collisions).

In addition, the project shifts its focus to 3D graphics in order to better test these systems' capabilities and limitations.

As a result of these changes, the project abandons Box2D in favor of a proprietary physics engine.

## Features
### Deformable Body
A deformable body in the form of a cloth, modeled using a simple mass-spring system (MSS), consisting of a series of nodes connected by a combination of structural, shear, and flexion springs.

### Particle System
A particle system meant to simulate fluids. Currently, it is implemented quite crudely, as particles are simply treated as individual rigid bodies with little to no consideration for actual fluid mechanics (e.g. Navier-Stokes equations). This is expected to change when the project is revisited in the future and a more apt model is chosen and implemented (e.g. smoothed-particle hydrodynamics).

Additionally, the particle system currently also has no way of interacting with the deformable body; this, too, will be implemented in the future, but only after the above changes have already been made.

## Build and Deployment
In the case that the .exe does not work (normally due to library linking errors), compile and run the code from Visual Studio by following the following steps:
 1. Set active solution configuration to
    <br>`Release`.
 3. Set active solution platform to
    <br>`x64`.
 5. In project properties, under `Debugging`, set `Environment` to
    <br>`PATH=../dll;%PATH$`.
 6. In project properties, under `C/C++`, set `Additional Include Directories` to
    <br>`../include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)`.
 8. In project properties, under `Linker`, set `Additional Library Directories` to
    <br>`../lib/GL;%(AdditionalLibraryDirectories)`.
 10. In project properties, under `Linker` â†’ `Input`, set `Additional Dependencies` to
     <br>`freeglut.lib;freeglutd.lib;glew32.lib;%(AdditionalDependencies)`.

## Controls
Simulation
 - `Spacebar` : start/pause the entire simulation.
 - `[` : start/pause the deformable body simulation.
 - `]` : start/pause the particle system simulation.
 - `r` : restart the entire simulation.
<br>

Deformable Body
 - `1` : view deformable body as nodes.
 - `2` : view deformable body as springs.
 - `3` : view deformable body as texture.
<br>

Particle System
 - `F1` : check collisions for every particle.
 - `F2` : check collisions for every particle that has not yet been checked.
 - `F3` : check collisions for particles using a neighbor search with spatial hashing. 
 - `+` : add 100 particles.
 - `-` : subtract 100 particles.
<br>

Rigid Body
 - `w` : move sphere forward.
 - `a` : move sphere left.
 - `s` : move sphere backward.
 - `d` : move sphere right.
<br>

Camera
 - `LMB` + Drag : move camera.
 - `RMB` + Drag : rotate camera.
 - `Scroll` : zoom camera.
<br>

## To-Do
 - Implement collisions between the deformable body and particles.
 - Alter the underlying physics of the particle system to more reflective of the equations of fluid mechanics.
 - Update code to use modern OpenGL. 
 - Otherwise general refactoring of code to meet current standards.
